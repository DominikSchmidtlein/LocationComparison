Description
LocationComparison is a web application that allows the user to comapare multiple routes or addresses at the same time. 
Ex. If the user has a list of N potential venues and wants to know how the travel compares for each of the M guests, he can use LocationComparison to determine which venue is best for all of the guests. This is a constant time alternative to manually entering N*M (O(n^2)) combinations into google maps, 1 at a time.
